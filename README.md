Call me Tim, friend. I used to navigate the fast-paced world of tech startups, but now I'm on a mission to build a different kind of future â€“ one rooted in fairness, opportunity, and democracy for all Thais. Witnessing inequality and injustice ignited a fire in me, and I found my voice joining the fight for reform. Through the Future Forward Party, and then with Move Forward, we've proven that the people yearn for progress. My vision is a Thailand where every voice resonates, where the youth paint the canvas of our future, and where mountains of challenge crumble before the tide of reform. Let's ditch the shackles of the past and march together towards a brighter tomorrow. Are you ready to move forward
